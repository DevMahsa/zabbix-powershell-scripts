# zabbix-powershell-scripts
I would like to share my codes related to zabbix powershell scripts. 
After downloading the codes, please put them in the C:\ folder. In order to call the code from zabbix you need to run the key "system.run[""]". 
Example: 	system.run["powershell.exe -NoProfile -Nologo -File C:\scripts\winfirewallon.ps1"]
